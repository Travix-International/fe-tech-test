# Travix Front-End Tech Assignment #02

The goal of this task is to implement a slot widget based on the provided image 
([Slot Widget Design](https://github.com/Travix-International/fe-tech-test/blob/master/assignment-02/slot-widget.png))
and show multiple slot widgets in a responsive design.
(Please check the mobile version of https://www.cheaptickets.nl/ for similar components)

A simple server has been implemented with Express, you need to first fetch the slot widgets' information, and then for each slot widget, 
you need to fetch the fare information by fareId. This server is not perfect. It could be improved and tested as well.

Please save the fare in Redux and then provide it to the components by reading it from the Redux store.
